INTRODUCTION

The Collapse of the Housing Bubble in China delves into contemporary issues facing China. The starting point is that a plethora of data points to the inevitable collapse of China’s real estate bubble in the 2020s. The collapse of financial capitalism’s logic in this industry goes beyond its surface-level implications and should be regarded as more than just an independent economic or industry crisis. Similar to Japan during the 1990s bubble economy, the collapse of the real estate market will not only lead to changes in housing typologies but also bring about changes in social structures, living forms, and even the urban context. Simultaneously, the housing market’s collapse represents a symbolic transformation of the four-decade-old system dominated by the big government in China, which prioritized “economic priorities” and rapid urbanization as the ultimate goals.

The thesis’ primary objective is to explore the new forms of living in China’s ‘post-real estate era’, which China had entered after real estate developers lost their absolute share in China’s housing industry. These new forms of living will be profoundly influenced by changes in power relations between the government, developers, and citizens resulting from the fall in land and housing prices and the rise of real estate tax. The burgeoning middle class in China, which has emerged in the hundreds of millions in the last two decades, will be a crucial subject of inquiry in this thesis. How they will exert influence in the housing system, fight for their agency, cooperate with the government/developers, and ultimately establish a new housing system will be explored.

Furthermore, the central argument’s ambition is to project such a change in living forms as a reflection of the state, providing the author with an opportunity to re-evaluate China’s past, present, and future. The thesis’s purpose is not to criticize capitalism, authoritarianism, or any other “-ism” in China using Western templates. On the contrary, this projection serves as an entry point to explore how different forces have played a role in the complex context during the past 70 years of the People’s Republic of China, which has undergone significant changes, ultimately shaping the prospect of China’s modernization.

THE CHANGING LIVING FORMS AS THE PROJECTION OF CHINA'S MODERNIZATION

Starting from a poor, planning, nearly bankrupt economy in the late 1970s, China has emerged as a world economic superpower over the past four decades. China’s economic miracle has profoundly challenged the conventional wisdom that property rights protection, an independent legal system, and a democratic government with checks and balances are requisite to support long-term growth. By international standards, China has a low ranking in the supply of all these institutional fundamentals.  

To be fair, the miracle of China’s economy is just as unbelievable for the Chinese as it is for Westerners. While the West may be perplexed by their lack of understanding of China, Chinese people may be even more perplexed by our excessive familiarity with the various flaws within China’s political and economic systems, the backwardness of Chinese technology, and the scarcity of resources per capita. This widespread confusion indicates that we still know too little about the causes of China’s rise, the conditions and mechanisms of economic growth, and the miracle of China itself. We need to reexamine China’s past, to reassess and appreciate the unique factors embedded in China’s economy, politics, and other institutions that have propelled China’s rapid takeoff in a relatively short period of time. This is not only a way to dispel the myth of China, but also a self-examination for Chinese people ourselves.

The transformation of China’s housing system since 1949 is, in a way, a reflection of the difficult and crucial transformation that this ancient and vast country is undergoing. Therefore, through the field of architecture, this thesis aims to provide a framework for understanding and reviewing China’s modernization process, using the collapse of the Chinese real estate system in the 2020s as a starting point. The third and fourth chapters present two abstract urban imaginations, which, although exploring future forms of urban life, can also be understood as imaginations of the promisingly uncertain future of China.
