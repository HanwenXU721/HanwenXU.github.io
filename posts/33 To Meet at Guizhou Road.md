## To Meet at Guizhou Road

"Meet at Guizhou Road" is a community-architecture activity hold by TM Studio in Shanghai. This event showcases a series of collaborations and outcomes between architects, local residents, and the community. It enables people to realize that the interplay between architectural design and everyday life is constantly unfolding in the city.

The documentary for this event has been produced and edited by me.
