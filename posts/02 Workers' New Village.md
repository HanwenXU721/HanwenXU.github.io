INTRODUCTION

Workers' New Villages are collective housing built by the government to solve the living problem of the working class in planned economic China from 1949 to the 1980s. The meaning of the workers' new village lies in solving the housing problems of the working class as the backbone of the People's Republic of China, significantly improving the living conditions of the lower working people. Workers' village was one of the most important residential types in China. Take Shanghai for example. From 1952 to 1995, 442 workers' villages were built, with a total floor area of 34.97 million square meters. As a typology of a particular era, the workers' new village combines the ideology and planning theory of the era, the typology of workers' new villages aims to establish a "new age" ethic and ideal housing model in the turbulent second half of the 20th century in China.

"all history is contemporary history". The study of workers' new villages is the study of collective living in the era of the planned economy in China, and also the study of contemporary Chinese cities from planned economy to market economy. Although the construction of the workers' new village was stopped with the reform and opening up in the late 1990s, the planning theory behind it still deeply influences the urban living froms in China today. In this context, the change of workers' new village has become a projection of the change of urban living forms in China.

CENTRALIZED FORM AND THE REBUILD OF COLLECTIVE

Workers' new village is the main body of urban housing construction from the 1950s to 1990s in China, and also the utopian collectivist living form established in the age of scarcity. The word "workers' new village" is not only the spatial sample in the era of planned economy China but also an important tool to construct the identity of workers (and most of the Chinese) through collective living. In addition, the workers' new village practice also directly led to the birth of the modern Chinese public housing system and the establishment of China's grass-roots social management system. These systems are still profoundly affecting the contemporary urban context in China.
  
In the case of Caoyang new village, it can be clearly found that different levels of spatial sharing establish the centralized collective life, allowing residents to bond the special relationship with neighbours or co-workers. 

The design exercise uses a similar strategy in Kaisariani, Athens. According to the reorganization of three levels, architectural elements, living units and urban blocks, a flexible and centralized form of living is constructed. This collective living fits Kaisariani's history and urban context and rebuilds the collective in this unique region.
