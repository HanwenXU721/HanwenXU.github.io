<h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>From the planned economy to the market economy, Chinese society has experienced drastic changes in the past 70 years. Among those most affected are young people born between 1980 and 2000, known as Generation Z. This group usually do not have experience of communal life in the planned economy ages. They usually have opportunities to gain high education in the university and flocked to the large cities for better opportunities after the collapse of the danwei system 1. However, the first challenge they face is the high housing prices and poor living conditions in large cities such as Shanghai and Beijing. There is a strong disconnect between their higher income levels and poor living conditions. This research mainly focuses on the Chinese government-led public housing rental policy started in 2010, which attempts to solve the living problem of this group of people according to the special social housing project. According to the analysis of four public housing under this context, a conceptual design exercise will be implemented in Barcelona, Spain.</p>

<h4 id="atomized-individual-and-the-architecture-as-machine">ATOMIZED INDIVIDUAL AND THE ARCHITECTURE AS MACHINE</h4>
<p>Unlike their parents, Chinese youth who did not experience the collective living of the planned economy show individualistic tendencies after leaving university in the 2000s. At the stage of transformation from students in university to humans in society, they are separated from the original collective. The youths are in the process of joining a new collective (this collective may be their company, family, and friends, rather than the collective of the temporary social housing), making them more similar to atomized individuals. Therefore, the public activities in such social housing are restrained and moderate in design.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this typology of social housing was conceived as a temporary dwelling from the beginning of design. In the case of Longnan Garden, the designer even considered the possibility of converting social housing into other types of buildings after 20 years.</p>
<p>Thus, social housing is considered by designers, managers and residents as a transient living machine designed to help the residents through a crisis state in their life (i.e. the transition from student to social person). In Michelle Foucault&#39;s Of Other Spaces, social housing can be regarded as a crisis heterotopia. This machine (the housing project) aims to build bonds between these youths and society rather than collective bonds within the transient collective</p>
