## Dishui Lake Pier (Under Construction)

Dishui Lake Pier is the first complete project I participate as an architect in TM Studio (梓耘斋建筑事务所), Shanghai. Located in the Dishui Lake area of Shanghai, the project is a public building commissioned by the Shanghai government with landscape and transportation functions.

As a junior architect, I was deeply involved in design and construction drawing. The construction of the project began in late 2021 and will be completed in 2023.
